Thieves guild will be a browser game, with it's own town, thief hideout, training, quests, NPCs, items and so on.

The game will be played top down ( or even sidescroller , why not) At first you'll have to join ( will be a quest ) with your summoner, it has to be either bard/rogue/fighter/wizard then you'll undergo training and once you become proficient enough you'll be able to steal,pickpocket,mug and so on. There will be different loot available, which can be wearable and will be displayed on the screen.
