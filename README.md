Brief description:

Thief's guild consists of members with different ranks based on experience (earned from guild quests ) inside the guild and a guild master. It has a treasury that can be managed by the Guild Master who can be conspired against by the members and be killed (voting power is determined by experience inside the guild ). Thus opening a window for a new master to be chosen. Allowed classes in the guild: rogue / bard / wizard / fighter (open to discussions).

The guild master can call different functions ( do strategic actions ) which will initiate a cooldown . As an example: a guild master at a given time can choose to either onboard new members to enlarge the treasury of the guild or call bribeGuards() function ( 1 of many different actions ) to reset guards' satisfaction level. If for example, guard's satisfaction level becomes too low they will raid the guild and take x% of the treasury and arrest the guild master for x time, rendering him unable to do further actions for the time being.

Guild members can do stealing quests everyday to gain guild xp, stealing quests may yield loot, ( loot can be different types for different classes ) loot fate is randomness is seeded by acceptanceTime ( open to discussions ).
